#  Terraform Project
## üöÄ Project Overview

This project provisions a highly available, multi-tier AWS infrastructure using Terraform.
---
### üß± Architecture Summary:
- **VPC (10.0.0.0/16)** with public and private subnets spread across two availability zones.
- **Public Subnets** host **proxy servers**  to route traffic.
- **Private Subnets** host **backend web servers** for handling application logic.
- **Security Groups** control traffic between layers to enforce strict access rules.
- An **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** distributes external traffic across proxies.
- The setup ensures **high availability**, **scalability**, and **network isolation**.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1.   Amazon S3 Storage 
**Purpose**: Stores Terraform state files securely with versioning enabled  
**Key Features**:
- Located in `us-east-1` (N. Virginia)
- IAM Access Analyzer enabled for security auditing
- Storage Lens metrics configured for cost monitoring

## 2.  DynamoDB State Locking

**Purpose**: Prevents concurrent Terraform executions that could corrupt state  
**Configuration**:
- Deletion protection enabled
- On-demand capacity mode

### 3. Security Groups

- **`bashar-pub-sg`**: Allows HTTP/HTTPS/SSH to proxy from anywhere.
- **`bashar-prv-sg`**: Allows only internal traffic from proxy SG and SSH access.
